- Credit card(s)
- Disbursement account

## Explanation

TODO explain about budgets living inside accounts, and how that is represented on the spreadsheet. Explain the meaning of all three accounts, and raux accounts like "Fast Offering".

TODO explain the MLE budget and the top-off fund

## When should I look at my finance spreadsheet?

1. Every first of the month (1-4) (before rent or the credit card is due)
2. Every time you get paid (6-8, 21-23)
3. Throughout the month periodically
4. At the end of the month (28-30)

### (1) Start the month

Not much to tell. Make sure the month's sheet makes sense. You should have ended the last month with a stocked checking account, with round numbers, so you should expect to see something similar now.

Pay the bills at this point. Log each expense (see part 3). Braeden, make absolutely sure to pay these:

1. Credit card balance
2. Rent
3. Internet

### (2) When you get paid

Log a row into the income table. The money went to your disbursement fund, your HSA, and your 401k, and each location should be accounted for correctly.

Pay tithing and fast offering. There's currently no way for a row on the table to have tithing and fast offering in a to-pay, pending state.

Put the rest of the money from the paycheck into savings budgets. Add to the "Deposit" cells of the appropriate funds, and also sum those changes up in the appropriate cells in the income table. Once that paperwork is done, transfer the money from the disbursement account into the correct savings account(s) corresponding to those funds.

How do you decide what funds to put things into? Once the monthly dues are paid on every annual expense, fill up your level 1, then 2, then 3 emergency funds. Remember that the level 2 emergency fund is the monthly living expenses (MLE) row, and it's not full till it's at a full year [??]. Then work on filling up long-term expense funds.

You can tell your work is done if:

1. The total amount added to each budget class this month matches both in the income table and in each income class table. If not, then you've summed your deposits to your budgets incorrectly.
2. The "Amount Remaining" for this income row is 0. If not, then either (2.1) is wrong too, or you didn't allocate all your earned income to a budget.
3. The balance of each savings account matches the balance of the accounts constituting it. If not, maybe you forgot to make the corresponding transfers from the disbursement account.
4. The disbursement fund is at its $100 base. If not, maybe you forgot to pay tithing or a fast offering.

### (3) Checking things

Everything in (3) is relevant in the other checks, too. It's mostly to log expenses.

To log an expense from a credit card or the main checking account, you add it to just one of three places:

1. Fixed expenses
2. Variable expenses
3. Withdrawal from a budget

With 3.3, withdrawal from a budget, you must also withdraw that money now from the appropriate savings account and add it to the checking account. Note that it is not important whether the expense was paid with the checking account or a credit card.

These regular checks are a great time to check the balance of things. Is any account getting close to 0? Is the credit card getting close to its limit? You can pay off the credit card from the main checking account *without recording it on the spreadsheet*. In the end, the checking account balance is adjusted down by the current balance on the credit card, and they count together as one big account.

You can tell that you're done when:

1. The "Total expenses" cell truly matches the money spent both on the credit card and the checking account. (Mathematically: "Initial checking balance" - "total expenses" = "checking account balance" - "credit card balance") ([??] This relies on the assumption that "total expenses" is just the fixed plus variable expenses, not the withdrawals from the budgets.) ([??] This relies on the assumption that no transactions from last month carried over. That's a reasonable assumption, since the "month" ends the moment you top off your checking/credit dual account, taking into account pending transactions.)

### (4) Ending the month

You end the month and start the next month.

Log the remaining transactions from the month. See step 3 for details. Consider pending transactions as if they had already happened. (You may consider planned transactions for the month as well, but you'll have to consider them manually in any later equations.)

Pay your credit card off using the main checking account, including pending transactions. Immediately afterward, top off your main checking up to a fixed amount, equal to 1.5-2.0 times your monthly living expenses. TODO from where? Any transactions that land in the accounts after this very moment will count on next month's budget. That includes any card purchases that end up on the statement in a couple days, although those should be small and rare. ([??] This assumes you *can* pay off pending transactions.)

TODO Shouldn't the amount deposited into the MLE equal the "Total expenses", which is also the amount required to top off the checking/credit dual account after the month is over?

## Further questions

- Q: What about pending transactions that aren't in the system yet?
- Q: Can we track planned transactions?
    - This is like a pending transaction. Sometimes we're not even sure it'll happen.
- Q: What about debt?
    - This is like a planned transaction.
- Q: What if I have a whole bunch of retirement "expenses" for the same income row?
    - Split up the income row into many spreadsheet pieces. Consolidate the tithing, fast offering, and "total remaining" rows by summing the relevant cells from all the spreadsheet rows. See Braeden's Lucid income rows from September.
- Q: How do I modify this if I only have one checking account?
